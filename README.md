# Memory Game Project

Hello.

This project is an example of a Memory Game for you to play.


## Dependencies

This app makes use of fonts from `fonts.googleapis.com` and icons from `maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com`.


## Game Features

The game features 16 cards face down.

You turn the card over by clicking on it.

When you turn two cards and they have the same icon, you score a point.

When you have successfully done so for all the cards on the deck, you win the game.

## Notes

This project includes HTML and CSS that was originally supplied by Udacity's @RichardKalehoff.

I'm responsible for
  1. the `app.js` file in the `js` folder that powers the app's functionality,
  2. the stopwatch section in the html and the related html changes due to the js file, and
  3. the css modifications to make the page more responsive to smaller screen sizes.


Have fun!
