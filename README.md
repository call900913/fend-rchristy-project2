# Memory Game Project

Hello.

This project is an example of a Memory Game for you to play.

This project includes HTML and CSS that was originally given by Udacity's @RichardKalehoff.

I'm responsible for the `app.js` file in the `js` folder that powers the app's functionality, as well as for the stopwatch section in the html.

You can visit the app by visiting https://call900913.github.io/fend-rchristy-project2/

Cheers!
